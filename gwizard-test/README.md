# GWizard Test

This is a tool for making integration-like tests. You can create a guice injector with a module configuration
similar to your application, inject objects into your tests, and call methods on them. There's also tooling
to simulate request contexts.

## Maven

Install the gwizard bom, then:

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.gwizard</groupId>
        <artifactId>gwizard-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
```
